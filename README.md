# zero_waste_kitchen

## Welcome!
At Zero Waste Kitchen we're here to combat the growing problem of food waste in the United States. American households generate an estimated 42 billion pounds of food waste each year. This is enough food to feed **21 million people each year**. 

The consequences of this waste not only has a direct impact on people but far reaching effects for the planet. **96% of this waste ends up in the landfill** - resulting in roughly 12 Million Tons of CO2 emissions. That amount of emissions is equivalent to powering 1.5 million homes for a year, or driving a car 2.6 million miles.

Our app is aimed at helping people eliminate food waste in their homes by providing recipes based on ingredients that will soon spoil and contribute to food waste. We hope to inspire users to waste less, save more and have an increased awareness around their personal impact and ability to contribute by having a Zero Waste Kitchen.
